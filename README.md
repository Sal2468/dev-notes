DNorton Dev Notes
=================

This repo contains my tips, tricks, and notes that I have found useful.

_short URL: <http://git.io/FWti>_

## My Most Used Notes
+ [unix-tips.md](unix-tips.md) -- this file contains lots of Unix commands that I never memorized but got tired of looking up constantly.
+ [git-commands.md](git-commands.md) -- local and remote git commands as well as some Github tips and tricks :octocat:
+ [intellij.md](intellij.md) -- keyboard shortcuts that make `IntelliJ` the most productive IDE ever!
+ [markdown.md](markdown.md) -- Markdown cheatsheet
+ [atom-io.md](atom-io.md) -- keyboard shortcuts for the [Atom](http://atom.io) editor
+ [cs-notes.md](cs-notes.md) -- general purpose Computer Science notes (data structures, algorithms, cryptography, etc)
+ [java-tips.md](java-tips.md) -- Java/JVM notes including libraries, debugging info, useful resources

## Scripts
_Very small utility scripts that have come in handy more than once._
+ [fr.py](scripts/fr.py) -- a find/replace python script
+ [dos2unix.sh](https://gist.github.com/dnorton/bdac1f49ce1e6da8f41f) -- for those times when dos2unix isn't installed
+ [find_sql_files.py](https://gist.github.com/dnorton/fb0fa9f80b6c9d71639a) -- fun with python list comprehensions
